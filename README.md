# Web.

## Introduction.

This is the web part of our project made during the Polyus Hackaton. Web part is divided in two sides: 
dispatcher side and customer side, both sides are united with a common authorization page. Project is 
divided into packages, each of which, excluding resources and libraries, is responsible for one single page.

## Getting started.

### Locally.

To start working, download this project, install Node.js from an official site, setup project 
dependencies by running `npm install`. Then install all required modules either by downloading 
`package.json` and `package-lock.json`, or simply by installing them manually. As it is done, you
can finally run the project by typing `npm start`. You will be readdressed to a web-page 
`http://localhost:3000/` in your favourite web-browser. Notice, that has strict connections with back,
so you have to run it on a different server as well.

### Remotely.

You can obviously run these code on a server to get access to a web-page from any device, connected to
an Internet. This might require installing `nginx` and `apache`, so we recommend you to take a close look
at those before getting started.
